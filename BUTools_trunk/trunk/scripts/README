BUTool WIB Scripts
==================

Configuring WIBs
----------------

To configure a WIB, setup your environment (cd ../; source env.sh; cd -) and
then run:

BUTool.exe -X config_<your configuration>.script

e.g.

BUTool.exe -X config_WIB_VST_RCE_default.script

to configure the VST RCE WIB with the default (real data) FEMB configuration.

Other configs include:

config_*_fake_WIB_data.script -- fake data generated on the WIB with the FEMBs powered off
config_*_fake_word.script -- fake data generated on the FEMBs with all channels and samples the same: FEX
config_*_fake_counter.script -- fake data generated on the FEMBs with all channels counting up
config_*_fake_channelid.script -- fake data generated on the FEMBs with each sample 0xXYZ
                                  with X the FEMB number, Y the chip number, and Z the channel number

These configs just include files from the WIB and FEMB directory. The WIB
config is split into _preFEMB and _postFEMB scripts because the FEMB config
needs to happen in the middle of the WIB configuration steps.

Dumping Debug Info for WIBs/FEMBs/RCEs/FELIX
--------------------------------------------

The dump_*.sh scripts should dump all information needed to debug a problem to
stdout. For example use:

./dump_vst_wib_rce.sh >& logVST_RCE

to dump debug info about the VST RCE WIB, associated FEMBs, and RCE to
logVST_RCE

Creating New Files
------------------

Please don't create new files in this directory or the WIB or FEMB
subdirectories unless they are generally useful. For testing or one-offs,
please put files in a subdirectory and use relative paths to load things.
