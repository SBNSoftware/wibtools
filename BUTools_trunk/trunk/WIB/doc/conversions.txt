Value conversions are specified in the address table using the "sc_conv" tag:
    sc_conv="name key1=value1 key2=value2"
    Where
        "name" is the name of one of the following conversions
        "key=value" pairs are parameters

The conversion "pass" is the default for all entries where "sc_conv" is
  unspecified.

The following value formatting conversions are currently supported:

    "pass":
        Copy the unsigned 32-bit integer unmodified.
        Parameters:
            None.

    "linear":
        Reinterpret the unsigned integer as a double floating value using a
          linear function:  output = input*scale + offset
        Parameters:
            "scale":   As in formula given.  Accepts exponential 'e' notation.
            "offset":  As in formula given.  Accepts exponential 'e' notation.

    "enum":
        Map numbers to strings.  The fixed string length is determined by the
          longest of the possible strings to be sent.
          If a number is not known, the following string will be used:
            "???? 0x00000000" with the number used as the hexadecimal value.
        Parameters: key=value pairs, where
          "key" must be an integer in one of the formats:
            starts with one of '1' through '9': Decimal
            starts with '0x': Hexadecimal
            starts with '0': Octal
          and "value" is the string associated with this number.
          Keys which cannot be interpreted as integers will be ignored and the
            format for unknown numbers will be used where needed.
